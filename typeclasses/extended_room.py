Extended Room

Evennia Contribution - Griatch 2012

This is an extended Room typeclass for Evennia. It is supported
by an extended `Look` command and an extended `@desc` command, also
in this module.


Features:

1) Time-changing description slots

This allows to change the full description text the room shows
depending on larger time variations. Four seasons (spring, summer,
autumn and winter) are used by default. The season is calculated
on-demand (no Script or timer needed) and updates the full text block.

There is also a general description which is used as fallback if
one or more of the seasonal descriptions are not set when their
time comes.

An updated `@desc` command allows for setting seasonal descriptions.

The room uses the `evennia.utils.gametime.GameTime` global script. This is
started by default, but if you have deactivated it, you need to
supply your own time keeping mechanism.


2) In-description changing tags

Within each seasonal (or general) description text, you can also embed
time-of-day dependent sections. Text inside such a tag will only show
during that particular time of day. The tags looks like `<timeslot> ...
</timeslot>`. By default there are four timeslots per day - morning,
afternoon, evening and night.


3) Details

The Extended Room can be "detailed" with special keywords. This makes
use of a special `Look` command. Details are "virtual" targets to look
at, without there having to be a database object created for it. The
Details are simply stored in a dictionary on the room and if the look
command cannot find an object match for a `look <target>` command it
will also look through the available details at the current location
if applicable. An extended `@desc` command is used to set details.


4) Extra commands

  CmdExtendedLook - look command supporting room details
  CmdExtendedDesc - @desc command allowing to add seasonal descs and details,
                    as well as listing them
  CmdGameTime     - A simple `time` command, displaying the current
                    time and season.


Installation/testing:

1) Add `CmdExtendedLook`, `CmdExtendedDesc` and `CmdGameTime` to the default `cmdset`
   (see Wiki for how to do this).
2) `@dig` a room of type `contrib.extended_room.ExtendedRoom` (or make it the
   default room type)
3) Use `@desc` and `@detail` to customize the room, then play around!
